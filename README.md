## Provides a simple Remix config for overriding most things located under the SlugcatStats class (runspeed, lungsfac, bodyweight etc.)

## Manual Installation
You can find most workshop mods hosted on RainDB! (http://www.raindb.net/)
  
  They will be kept up to date, but are only updated on a roughly weekly basis, so unfortunately if a mod is new / recently updated, you may have to wait for the latest release!
